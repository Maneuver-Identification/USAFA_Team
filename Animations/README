This document provides brief instructions on how animations were created from the segmented data set. The animations are stored in GL Transmission Format (gltf) files. To understand how the data was segmented, please reference the preprocessing folder.

## Blender Initalization glTF animations

The .blend file used for this animation sequence is labeled as animation.blend. This contains settings not specified with the python code such as the clipping distance, background data, and the initalization of the plane.

## Modifying Data

Blender animation framework does treats a rotation of 360 degrees separately than a rotation of 0 degrees. Since our data can abruptly change from 360 to 0 on heading (moving slightly west of north to slightly east of north) and from -180 to 180 on bank (as the plane goes inverted), additional modifications must occur so the animation appears accurate. By smoothing out the angles, this may also help for other data techniques in the future. The code used to modify the angles is provided under the translate.py file. 

## Creating glTF animations

A python script, createGLTFanimation.py, was used to interact with blenders bpy programming interface. This program creates all the animation keyframes for the plane from a given file. This python script takes two parameters: 1) path to the data, and 2) location to output the video.

A bash script, generateAllAnimations.sh, is used to iterivley run the command to generate the glTF animation for each sortie. This bash file takes one command line arguement which is the path to the directory containing the modified tsv files for animation.

## Creating AVI Videos

Another visitation program was created to render videos using blender OpenGL viewport rendering. This required two files, video.blend and generateVideo.py. The python script takes in three parameters: 1) path to the data, 2) location to output the video, and 3) the camera to animation (options are "ISO_CAM", "REAR_CAM", and "SIDE_CAM")

Similar to the glTF files, a bash script, generateAllVideos.sh, is used to iterivley run the command to generate videos from all camera angles for each sortie. This bash file takes one command line arguement which is the path to the directory containing the modified tsv files for animation.

## Conclusion

Now, the data set has useful glTF and video files to aid in labeling and validating models. 

## Additional Notes

Through testing the code, three sorties were identified as erroneous due to missing data points. The sorties, 13001367004, 13001419002, and 13001367004, were missing heading values since the aircraft was vertical, causing no heading values. These were fixed by averaging the two surrounding data points.
